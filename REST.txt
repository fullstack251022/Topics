REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is an architectural style for designing web services.
A RESTful API is a type of web API that uses HTTP requests to GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), and DELETE (delete) data.

RESTful APIs are based on a client-server model, where the server provides a set of URLs, 
or endpoints, that the client can access to perform certain actions.
The data is usually sent in JSON format, which is a lightweight data format that is easy to read and parse.

In simpler terms, a RESTful API is a way for applications to communicate with each other over the internet,
using a set of rules that make it easy to understand and use.
It allows developers to build applications that can access data from other applications, and perform actions like creating, updating, or deleting data.
